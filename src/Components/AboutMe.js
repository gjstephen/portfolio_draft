      <p>Hi, I am George.</p>
      <p>I am a recent graduate of the General Assembley Software Engineering Immersive with a background in Accounting. I have a passion for critical thinking and creative problem solving that I started to develop during my career in audit. I decided to take it to the next level to really take advantage of my enthusiasm and skill in these areas and learn to code. I have really enjoyed my experiences in building all of my projects and feel highly vindicated in my decision.</p>
